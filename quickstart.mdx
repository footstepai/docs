Footstep is a routing API that adds terrain intelligence to every response. Send two coordinates and you get back directions, distance, duration, and a full elevation breakdown — ascent, descent, grade profiles, and a difficulty classification — all in one call.

This guide walks you through your first request.

## Get an API key

Sign up at [console.footstep.ai](https://console.footstep.ai) and create an API key. Your key will look like `sk_live_abc123...` — keep it safe, as it's used to authenticate every request.

<Warning>
API keys are for server-side use only. Never expose them in frontend code, mobile apps, or anywhere a user could inspect network traffic.
</Warning>

## Your first request

Every routing request needs at least two locations — a start and an end. Each location is a `lat`/`lon` pair. Here's a route from King's Cross to Tower Bridge in London:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.footstep.ai/v1/routing/route \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_live_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locations": [
      { "lat": 51.5322, "lon": -0.1240 },
      { "lat": 51.5055, "lon": -0.0754 }
    ]
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.footstep.ai/v1/routing/route", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": "sk_live_your_key_here",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    locations: [
      { lat: 51.5322, lon: -0.1240 },
      { lat: 51.5055, lon: -0.0754 },
    ],
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.footstep.ai/v1/routing/route",
    headers={"x-api-key": "sk_live_your_key_here"},
    json={
        "locations": [
            {"lat": 51.5322, "lon": -0.1240},
            {"lat": 51.5055, "lon": -0.0754},
        ]
    },
)

data = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

That's all you need. No transport mode, no options, no configuration — the defaults give you a car route with full terrain analytics.

## Understand the response

The response contains a `route` object with everything you need:

```json
{
  "route": {
    "distance_m": 5765,
    "duration_s": 812,
    "terrain": {
      "total_ascent_m": 12.4,
      "total_descent_m": 8.1,
      "max_elevation_m": 28,
      "min_elevation_m": 5,
      "avg_grade_percent": 1.2,
      "max_grade_percent": 4.5,
      "elevation_profile": [
        { "distance_m": 0, "elevation_m": 22 },
        { "distance_m": 500, "elevation_m": 18 },
        { "distance_m": 1000, "elevation_m": 15 }
      ],
      "difficulty": "flat"
    },
    "legs": [
      {
        "distance_m": 5765,
        "duration_s": 812,
        "steps": [
          {
            "instruction": "Drive north on Midland Road.",
            "distance_m": 120,
            "duration_s": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here's what the key fields mean:

| Field | What it tells you |
|-------|-------------------|
| `distance_m` | Total route distance in meters |
| `duration_s` | Estimated travel time in seconds |
| `terrain.total_ascent_m` | Total climbing over the route in meters |
| `terrain.total_descent_m` | Total descending over the route in meters |
| `terrain.elevation_profile` | Array of distance/elevation points for charting |
| `terrain.difficulty` | Overall classification: `flat`, `rolling`, `hilly`, or `mountainous` |
| `legs[].steps[]` | Turn-by-turn directions with distance and time per manoeuvre |

<Note>
All field names include their unit — `distance_m` is always meters, `duration_s` is always seconds, `grade_percent` is always a percentage. This is true regardless of the `units` parameter you send in the request.
</Note>

## Change transport mode

The default mode is `auto` (car). You can switch to walking, cycling, or other modes using the `costing` parameter:

```json
{
  "locations": [
    { "lat": 51.5322, "lon": -0.1240 },
    { "lat": 51.5055, "lon": -0.0754 }
  ],
  "costing": "pedestrian"
}
```

| Mode | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `auto` | Car routing (default) |
| `pedestrian` | Walking and hiking — factors in terrain, avoids motorways |
| `bicycle` | Cycling — considers surface type and hill gradients |
| `bus` | Bus routing |
| `truck` | Truck routing — respects vehicle dimensions and weight limits |

Each mode produces different routes and terrain analytics. A `pedestrian` route through hilly terrain will show significantly different `difficulty` and grade profiles compared to the same coordinates with `auto`.

## Try GeoJSON format

By default, responses use the `footstep` format — compact JSON with encoded polyline geometry. If you're working with mapping libraries or GIS tools, you can request GeoJSON instead:

```json
{
  "locations": [
    { "lat": 51.5322, "lon": -0.1240 },
    { "lat": 51.5055, "lon": -0.0754 }
  ],
  "format": "geojson"
}
```

This returns a standard [GeoJSON FeatureCollection](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946) with decoded coordinate arrays. You can paste the response directly into [geojson.io](https://geojson.io) to visualise it, or load it into Leaflet, Mapbox GL, deck.gl, or QGIS without any transformation.

description: "Authenticate requests with your API key"

Every request to the Footstep API must include an API key. This page explains how keys work, what happens when authentication fails, and how to keep your keys secure.

## How it works

Pass your API key in the `x-api-key` header on every request. The API validates the key before processing. If it's missing, malformed, or invalid, the request is rejected immediately.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.footstep.ai/v1/routing/route \
  -H "x-api-key: sk_live_your_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"locations": [{"lat": 51.5322, "lon": -0.1240}, {"lat": 51.5055, "lon": -0.0754}]}'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.footstep.ai/v1/routing/route", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "x-api-key": process.env.FOOTSTEP_API_KEY,
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    locations: [
      { lat: 51.5322, lon: -0.1240 },
      { lat: 51.5055, lon: -0.0754 },
    ],
  }),
});
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.footstep.ai/v1/routing/route",
    headers={"x-api-key": os.environ["FOOTSTEP_API_KEY"]},
    json={
        "locations": [
            {"lat": 51.5322, "lon": -0.1240},
            {"lat": 51.5055, "lon": -0.0754},
        ]
    },
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Key format

All API keys follow the format `sk_live_*` (e.g. `sk_live_abc123def456`). If the key you're sending doesn't start with `sk_live_`, the API will reject it with a `401`.

Create and manage keys at [console.footstep.ai](https://console.footstep.ai).

## Key states

Keys can be in one of several states. The API checks the key's state on every request:

| State | HTTP status | Error message | What to do |
|-------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Active | `200` | — | Key is working normally |
| Suspended | `403` | `API key is suspended` | Contact support. Your key has been temporarily disabled |
| Revoked | `403` | `API key has been revoked` | Generate a new key in the console. Revoked keys cannot be reactivated |
| Not found | `403` | `Invalid API key` | Check for typos. If correct, the key may have been deleted |
| Missing or malformed | `401` | `Missing or invalid API key format` | Ensure you're sending the `x-api-key` header with a valid `sk_live_*` key |

<Note>
A `401` means the request had no valid key at all. A `403` means the key was recognised but isn't allowed: it's been suspended, revoked, or doesn't exist.
</Note>

## Security best practices

<Warning>
API keys are for server-side use only. Never expose them in frontend code, mobile apps, or browser JavaScript. Anyone who has your key can make requests on your behalf.
</Warning>

- **Use environment variables.** Store keys in `FOOTSTEP_API_KEY` or your platform's secret manager, not in source code.
- **Never include keys in query strings.** Query strings appear in server logs, browser history, and CDN caches. Always use the `x-api-key` header.
- **Rotate keys regularly.** Generate a new key in the console, update your services, then revoke the old one.
- **Use separate keys per environment.** Different keys for development, staging, and production make it easier to rotate and audit.
- **Restrict access.** Only share keys with services that need them. If a key is compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a replacement.
